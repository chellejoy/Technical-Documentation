        Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code.
      </p>

        Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.
        There are two major Python versions: Python 2 and Python 3. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
         1) Finding an Interpreter:



Before we start Python programming, we need to have an interpreter to interpret and run our programs. There are certain online interpreters like https://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/, http://ideone.com/ or http://codepad.org/ that can be used to run Python programs without installing an interpreter.

Windows: There are many interpreters available freely to run Python scripts like IDLE (Integrated Development Environment) that comes bundled with the Python software downloaded from http://python.org/.

Linux: Python comes preinstalled with popular Linux distros such as Ubuntu and Fedora. To check which version of Python you’re running, type “python” in the terminal emulator. The interpreter should start and print the version number.

macOS: Generally, Python 2.7 comes bundled with macOS. You’ll have to manually install Python 3 from http://python.org/.
        </li>
        <li>
          2) Writing our first program:
          Line 1: [# Script Begins] In Python, comments begin with a #. This statement is ignored by the interpreter and serves as documentation for our code.

Line 2: [print(“GeeksQuiz”)] To print something on the console, print() function is used. This function also adds a newline after our message is printed(unlike in C). Note that in Python 2, “print” is not a function but a keyword and therefore can be used without parentheses. However, in Python 3, it is a function and must be invoked with parentheses.

Line 3: [# Script Ends] This is just another comment like in Line 1.

        Create a folder called PythonPrograms on your C:\ drive. 
        You will be storing all your Python programs in this folder.
        Go to Start and either type Run in the Start Search box at the bootom or click on Run.
        Type in notepad in the field called Open.
        In Notepad type in the following program exactly as written
      </p>

      <p>
       Go to Start and click on Run.
       Type cmd in the Open field and click OK.
       If you type dir you will get a listing of all folders in your C: drive. You should see the folder PythonPrograms that you created.
       Type cd PythonPrograms and hit Enter. It should take you to the PythonPrograms folder.
       Type dir and you should see the file Hello.py.
       To run the program, type python Hello.py and hit Enter.
       You should see the line Hello World!
       Congratulations, you have run your first Python program.

        Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

      From the File menu in TextEdit click on Save As.
      In the field Save As: type Hello.py.
      Select Documents and the file folder PythonPrograms.
      Click Save.
      <code
        >In a Terminal window, type python. 
        This will start the Python shell.
         The prompt for that is >>>
      </code>

      At the Python shell prompt type import idlelib.idle
         This will start the IDLE IDE

    <p>
      A Python variable is a reserved memory location to store values. In other words, a variable in a python program gives data to the computer for processing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every value in Python has a datatype. Different data types in Python are Numbers, List, Tuple, Strings, Dictionary, etc. Variables in Python can be declared by any name or even alphabets like a, aa, abc, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us define variable in Python where the variable “f” is global in scope and is assigned value 101 which is printed in output.
     Variable f is again declared in function and assumes local scope. 
     It is assigned value “I am learning Python.” which is printed out as an output. This Python declare variable is different from the global variable “f” defined earlier.
     Once the function call is over, the local variable f is destroyed. At line 12, when we again, print the value of “f” is it displays the value of global variable f=101

      Declaring variables in Python requires declaring the number as string otherwise it will show a TypeError.
      <p>
        With the keyword var. For example, <code>var a = "Guru" b= 99 print a+b</code> For the following code, you will get undefined output –
      </p>
      <p>
        By simply assigning it a value. For example, <code>a = "Guru" b= 99 print(a+str(b))</code> Once the integer is declared as string, it can concatenate both “Guru” + str(“99”)= “Guru99” in the output.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can also delete Python variables using the command del “variable name”.
      </p>

      <p>
       Example of Python delete variable or Python clear variable :
       f = 11;
       print(f)
       del f
       print(f)
